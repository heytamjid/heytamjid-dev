> "One of the risks of being quiet is that the other people can fill your silence with their own interpretation: You’re bored. You’re depressed. You’re shy. You’re stuck up. You’re judgemental. When others can’t read us, they write their own story—not always one we choose or that’s true to who we are."

from Sophia Dembling. The Introvert’s Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World.
