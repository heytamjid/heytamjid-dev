Now summer is gone.

And might never have been.

In the sunshine it’s warm.

But there has to be more.

<br>

It all came to pass,

All fell into my hands

Like a five-petalled leaf,

But there has to be more.

<br>

Nothing evil was lost,

Nothing good was in vain,

All ablaze with clear light

But there has to be more.

<br>

Life gathered me up

Safe under its wing,

My luck always held,

But there has to be more.

<br>

Not a leaf was burnt up

Not a twig ever snapped …

Clean as glass is the day,

But there has to be more.

<br>
~ by Arseny Tarkovsky
