      <description>&lt;p&gt;For days now, a strange sensation has taken root in me. It is as if I have been shot somehow, and blood is gushing through the gaps of my fingers in an unrelenting endless flow, without pause, without mercy, without any haste or hesitation, but with a measured, inevitable grace. And I can&amp;rsquo;t stop it in no means. It does not pool or clot, it simply leaves, abandoning the very me, slipping from each corridors of my body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been solving DP problems for last 2 days and guess what, they are really cooool and fun to solve. Previously I didn’t enjoy this much while solving topic-wise problems on Prefix Sum or Sliding Window. &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/description/&#34;&gt;Dungeon Game&lt;/a&gt; is my first solved bottom-up DP problem. It’s marked as hard, but I believe it is sort of quite medium level problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In DP problems, the main part is to find out what to remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/YBSt1jYwVfU?si=VWSg2Xta6vAQrQXk&amp;amp;t=1090&#34;&gt;as Errichto said&lt;/a&gt;. And for that, you have to know the right question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
