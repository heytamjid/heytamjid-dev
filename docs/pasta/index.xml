      <description>Now summer is gone.
And might never have been.
In the sunshine it’s warm.
But there has to be more.
It all came to pass,
All fell into my hands
Like a five-petalled leaf,
But there has to be more.
Nothing evil was lost,
Nothing good was in vain,
All ablaze with clear light
But there has to be more.
Life gathered me up
Safe under its wing,
My luck always held,</description>

      <title>Being Quite</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One of the risks of being quiet is that the other people can fill your silence with their own interpretation: You’re bored. You’re depressed. You’re shy. You’re stuck up. You’re judgemental. When others can’t read us, they write their own stories—not always one we choose or that’s true to who we are.&amp;rdquo;
 from Sophia Dembling. The Introvert’s Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World.</description>

      <description>No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.
