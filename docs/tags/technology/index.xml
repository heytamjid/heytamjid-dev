      <description>My suggestion for novice PC users who are thinking of building a PC for causal usage is to avoid online PC builder hobbyists. Most PC builders community online are often some too-enthusiastic people out there who are more into keeping the latest-fastest-unnecessarily_overclocked PC in one corner of their room. It’s their HOBBY (not necessity) to squeeze every hz of their processor &amp;amp; other components often completely unnecessarily only to waste their time gaming and commenting on their communities :v So get whatever is decent for your workload and don’t chase for the someday-i-might-need-this-feature or the never-obsolete-PC. No tech is future-proof. It will start becoming obsolete or at least old in terms of technology even before you realize it, but most probably it will keep working and you will not upgrade it until it REALLY sucks – it is when it can’t do what you NEED to do. Most potato users build a PC maybe once a decade unlike these hobbyists so know that you are not on the same ground as the people you are taking advice from.</description>
