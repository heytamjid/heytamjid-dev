      <description>But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say, &amp;ldquo;Peace be upon you; you have become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein,&amp;rdquo; [they will enter].
  And they will say, &amp;ldquo;Praise to Allāh, who has fulfilled for us His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle in Paradise wherever we will.</description>

      <description>There are seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.</description>
