      <title>01 Matrix on LeetCode: Multi-Source BFS and Two-pass DP Solution</title>
      <link>https://tamjid.me/posts/01-matrix/</link>

      <description>In Multi-source BFS, we start from multiple source nodes simultaneously instead of starting from a single source node, In this case, all the 0 cells act as the initial sources, and we expand outward in all directions. This works efficiently because BFS inherently explores all nodes layer by layer, guaranteeing that the first time we reach a cell, it is via the shortest possible path. Unlike the naive approach of running BFS separately for each 1 cell (which would be too slow), multi-source BFS spreads out from all 0s in parallel. Again, BFS processes each cell exactly once so this solution will run in O(m*n). As of the DP solution, &lt;strong&gt;the recursive approach must NOT create cyclic dependencies.&lt;/strong&gt; When we are computing the distance for a cell, we are making recursive calls to all its neighbors, right?. But if two cells depend on each other, for example, cell A calls cell B, which in turn calls cell A (or another cell that eventually calls A) before A’s value is finalized, you’ll end up in an infinite loop or incorrect results because the dp value for A is still set to –1 when B checks it. In recursive DP, if we do not &lt;strong&gt;ensure that all dependent subproblems are solved before the current cell’s computation,&lt;/strong&gt; the recursion can “chase its tail” or run infinitely and never reach a stable solution.</description>

      <description>For days now, a strange sensation has taken root in me. It is as if I have been shot somehow, and blood is gushing through the gaps of my fingers in an unrelenting endless flow, without pause, without mercy, without any haste or hesitation, but with a measured, inevitable grace. And I can&amp;rsquo;t stop it in no means. It does not pool or clot, it simply leaves, abandoning the very me, slipping from each corridors of my body.</description>

      <description>Now summer is gone.
And might never have been.
In the sunshine it’s warm.
But there has to be more.
It all came to pass,
All fell into my hands
Like a five-petalled leaf,
But there has to be more.
Nothing evil was lost,
Nothing good was in vain,
All ablaze with clear light
But there has to be more.
Life gathered me up
Safe under its wing,
My luck always held,</description>

      <title>Tech To Be Obsoleted</title>
      <link>https://tamjid.me/posts/tech-to-be-obsoleted/</link>

      <description>My suggestion for novice PC users who are thinking of building a PC for causal usage is to avoid online PC builder hobbyists. Most PC builders community online are often some too-enthusiastic people out there who are more into keeping the latest-fastest-unnecessarily_overclocked PC in one corner of their room. It’s their HOBBY (not necessity) to squeeze every hz of their processor &amp;amp; other components often completely unnecessarily only to waste their time gaming and commenting on their communities :v So get whatever is decent for your workload and don’t chase for the someday-i-might-need-this-feature or the never-obsolete-PC. No tech is future-proof. It will start becoming obsolete or at least old in terms of technology even before you realize it, but most probably it will keep working and you will not upgrade it until it REALLY sucks – it is when it can’t do what you NEED to do. Most potato users build a PC maybe once a decade unlike these hobbyists so know that you are not on the same ground as the people you are taking advice from.</description>

      <title>Dungeon Game on LeetCode : Finding The Right Question To Ask in DP Problems</title>
      <link>https://tamjid.me/posts/dungeon-game/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been solving DP problems for last 2 days and guess what, they are really cooool and fun to solve. Previously I didn’t enjoy this much while solving topic-wise problems on Prefix Sum or Sliding Window. &lt;a href=&#34;https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/description/&#34;&gt;Dungeon Game&lt;/a&gt; is my first solved bottom-up DP problem. It’s marked as hard, but I believe it is sort of quite medium level problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DP problems, the main part is to find out &lt;strong&gt;what to remember&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/YBSt1jYwVfU?si=VWSg2Xta6vAQrQXk&amp;amp;t=1090&#34;&gt;as Errichto said&lt;/a&gt;. And for that, you have to know &lt;strong&gt;the right question to ask&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Something Wicked This Way Comes</title>

      <description>A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know, is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One of the risks of being quiet is that the other people can fill your silence with their own interpretation: You’re bored. You’re depressed. You’re shy. You’re stuck up. You’re judgemental. When others can’t read us, they write their own stories—not always one we choose or that’s true to who we are.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.

      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>

      <description>But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say, &amp;ldquo;Peace be upon you; you have become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein,&amp;rdquo; [they will enter].
  And they will say, &amp;ldquo;Praise to Allāh, who has fulfilled for us His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle in Paradise wherever we will.</description>

      <description>There are seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.</description>
